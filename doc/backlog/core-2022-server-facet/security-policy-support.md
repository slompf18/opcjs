# SecurityPolicy Support

**Facet**: Core 2022 Server Facet  
**Type**: Required  
**Status**: ❌ Not Implemented  

## Description

The server must support at least one Security Policy. Support of `SecurityPolicy#None` is recommended for testing and compatibility reasons, even if the server also supports more secure policies.

**Server responsibilities**:
- Implement at least one of the following security policies:
  - `SecurityPolicy#None` — no security (recommended for test/dev)
  - `SecurityPolicy#Basic256Sha256` — RSA with SHA-256 (recommended)
  - `SecurityPolicy#Aes128_Sha256_RsaOaep` — RSA-OAEP with AES-128 and SHA-256
  - `SecurityPolicy#Aes256_Sha256_RsaPss` — RSA-PSS with AES-256 and SHA-256
  - ECC-based policies (see ECC-nistP256, ECC-nistP384, etc.)
- Expose all supported policies in the endpoints returned by `GetEndpoints`.
- For each secure policy, hold a valid `ApplicationInstanceCertificate` and use it during `OpenSecureChannel`.

**Recommendation**: Servers should support multiple policies and allow the administrator to configure which are enabled and which is the default.
